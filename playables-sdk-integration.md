add all sdk requirements - YouTube Playables SDK is a web SDK for connecting web games with the YouTube
environment. The SDK features a robust API to support games in a variety of ways
to create an excellent gaming experience on YouTube.

## Add the Playables SDK to your game

A game should have an `index.html` file in the root directory. Import the
YouTube Playables SDK by adding this line before any of your game code:

    <script src="https://www.youtube.com/game_api/v1"></script>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important:** The SDK **MUST** be loaded before any of your game code. This creates a reproducible, sandboxed environment and make certain functions available to the game immediately. This is validated during publishing and you can follow the [test suite guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/test_suite_guide) to validate before submitting your game.

The SDK runs as a no-op when your game is served locally. To verify SDK
integration correctness, use the [test suite guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/test_suite_guide).

## Integrate with Playables SDK

There are several required and optional integrations with the Playables SDK.

### Required integrations

Review the [publishing requirements](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/certification/requirements) overall, with a focus on [integration
requirements](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/certification/requirements_integration). Review the [Playables SDK reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/sdk) for implementation details.

Examples include:

- `ytgame.game.firstFrameReady()`
- `ytgame.game.gameReady()`
- `ytgame.IN_PLAYABLES_ENV`
- `ytgame.system.isAudioEnabled()`
- `ytgame.system.onAudioEnabledChange((isAudioEnabled) => {})`
- `ytgame.system.onPause(() => {})`
- `ytgame.system.onResume(() => {})`
- `ytgame.game.loadData()`
- `ytgame.game.saveData(data)`

### Recommended integrations

In addition to the required integrations, several other functions are available
to create a highly engaging experience. Examples include:

- `ytgame.system.getLanguage()` - Use this to retrieve the user's current locale setting. Don't use other functions or store the language in the cloud save, as this may change at any time.
- `ytgame.engagement.sendScore({ value: newScore })` - Send a best score to YouTube to display.
- `ytgame.engagement.openYTContent({ id: videoID })` - Open a YouTube video.
- `ytgame.health.logError()` and `ytgame.health.logWarning()` - Log issues to YouTube.
- `ytgame.ads.requestInterstitialAd()` and `requestRewardedAd(rewardId:
  string)` - Integrate ads features into your game.

Review the [Playables SDK reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/sdk) for implementation details and additional
functions.

### TypeScript type definitions

For games using TypeScript, [download type definitions](https://www.youtube.com/playablesportal/static/youtube_ytgame_web_deploy_mpm_files/index.d.ts).

### Sample games

[Samples are available](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/samples/oss_samples) that demonstrate how to integrate with YouTube
Playables SDK, including plain JavaScript, Flutter web, Godot, and Unity.

## Test your game with the test suite

Once you are ready, you can validate your integration using the test suite. To
learn how, follow the [test suite guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/test_suite_guide). > [!IMPORTANT]

[Go to the SDK Test Suite](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/test_suite)

## Test http response headers

When your game is served on YouTube, it includes a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
response header as an added layer of security.

This limits the kinds of sources Playables can depend on and the kinds of
network requests that can be made from Playables. To minimize issues with
certification and improve the integration process, override the HTTP response
headers for your `index.html` file when testing locally to catch CSP violations
as early as possible.

You can follow this [article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overrides) to set up local overrides in Chrome.
Once you have your overrides setup for your locally served game, use the
following string to override the `Content-Security-Policy` header:

    default-src 'none'; script-src 'report-sample' 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' blob: https://www.youtube.com/game_api/v0 https://www.youtube.com/game_api/v0/ https://www.youtube.com/game_api/v1 https://www.youtube.com/game_api/v1/; object-src 'none'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' blob: data:; media-src 'self' blob:; font-src 'self' data: https://fonts.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' blob: data:; sandbox allow-pointer-lock allow-same-origin allow-scripts; base-uri 'self'; manifest-src 'self'; worker-src 'self' blob:Turn your Playables into revenue with YouTube's built-in monetization.

## Understand ads-based monetization

YouTube offers built-in monetization functions for games, starting with ads. We
support three ad opportunities with your games:

- **Pre-roll ads**: Ads shown while your game is initially loading
- **Interstitial ads**: Ads shown during a natural breakpoint within the game, such as level completion
- **Rewarded ads**: Ads that users opt into viewing in exchange for in-game items or experiences

A subset of users in [Playables-eligible regions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328604) and platforms see these ad
slots.

We'll keep you updated as we continue to enhance and expand ads-based
monetization.

## Integrate with ads-based monetization

YouTube handles pre-roll ads automatically---no integration work is required on
your end.

While YouTube handles pre-roll ads automatically, you can implement interstitial
and rewarded ads in about 5 minutes using the [Playables SDK ads features](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/sdk#ytgame.ads).

> [!TIP]
> **Tip:** **Handle errors gracefully**: Players will engage with your game across a wide range of devices and network conditions. Always implement fallback logic in your code to handle situations where an ad request fails.

### Prerequisites

Before integrating:

- Ensure you have access to the [Playables Test Suite](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/test_suite) to verify your integration.
- If your game uses TypeScript, ensure you have the latest [type definitions](https://www.youtube.com/playablesportal/static/youtube_ytgame_web_deploy_mpm_files/index.d.ts) to make integration easier.
- Check if [code samples](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/samples/oss_samples) are available that demonstrate how to integrate with YouTube Playables SDK.

### Integrate interstitial ads

Interstitial ads take just a minute to implement. Simply call
[`requestInterstitialAd()`](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/sdk#ytgame.ads.requestInterstitialAd) at logical pauses in your gameplay, such as
**between levels** , after a "**Game Over** " screen, or during **mid-game
loading** sequences:

    try {
      await ytgame.ads.requestInterstitialAd();
      // Ad request successful
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors, retry logic, etc.
    }

### Integrate rewarded ads

Rewarded ads are equally quick to integrate. Call [`requestRewardedAd(id)`](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/sdk#ytgame.ads.requestRewardedAd)
whenever a player explicitly requests a rewarded ad.

**You must select and pass a unique reward ID**. You can hard-code these IDs
directly into your game.

When creating your IDs, follow these requirements:

- **Do not** include any user data.
- **Do** use a readable string (e.g., `"100-coins-reward-12"`) or a standard UUID (e.g., `"21403813-2e22-4316-a8b2-7d4f52a6f6fb"`).

details and additional examples.

## Test ads-based monetization

Once you are ready, you can validate your integration using the [Playables Test
Suite](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/test_suite). To
learn how, follow the [test suite guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/gaming/playables/reference/test_suite_guide).

Ads are also enabled for development and staging game releases, though they are
limited to a subset of [Playables-eligible regions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328604) and platforms.

## Manage ads-based monetization

Once integrated, you can control some of these ad types for your game in the
[Playables Developer Portal](https://www.youtube.com/playables_portal) if you need to toggle them off or on for testing or
validation. These ad types default to "on".

## Next steps

### Revenue sharing pilot

We are in the initial phase of Playables monetization. To get early feedback, we
are piloting revenue sharing with a select number of Playable creators. We aim
to align with the broader YouTube monetization programs over time, enabling us
to scale the number of creators who earn from Playables monetization. We will
share more information as the program expands.
